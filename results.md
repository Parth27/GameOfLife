## Goal : To test the hypothesis that "better(Li, Lj)" by tracking the debug time.
## Methods 
The 3 languages we decided to compare are Scala, Kotlin and Go. To do this we implemented Conway's Game of Life in all three languages and introduced the same bugs in each code: 1 syntactical and 1 logical. We gave each subject the code for one language to debug and kept track of the amount of time they took to debug the code. After this we asked the subject to fill out a survey that gave us an idea about their experience with the language.   
## Materials
## Observations
## Conclusions
## Threats to validity
- Challenge 1: How much of that tracking can you automate?
- Challenge 2: What parts of this analysis should not be automated? How would you do that ?
- Challenge 3: How to control for the background experience of the subject?
